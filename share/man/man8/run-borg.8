.Sh NAME
.Nm run-borg
.Nd run
.Xr borg 1
with the standard parameters for a system backup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets up the system to perform a backup and then invokes
.Xr borg-create 1
to do so. Specifically, it:
.Bl -enum
.It
Acquires the system Borg lock
.Xr borg.lock 5
(or bails out)
.It
Creates a recursive ZFS snapshot of
.Pa /
and mounts it at
.Pa /media/borg-stage
.It
Determines whether to include system files based on the presence of
.Pa /var/local/borg-trigger-system-backup
.It
Invokes
.Xr borg-create 1
with the standard parameters for compression, cache exclusion, etc.
.El
.Pp
There are no options.
If you need something else, use
.Xr run-borg-custom 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
When running under
.Xr chronic 1 ,
stderr output for the following errors is suppressed:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Failure to acquire
.Xr run-borg.lock 5
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
This behavior is modified when
.Nm
is running under
.Xr chronic 1 .
Specifically, errors that cause stderr to be suppressed (see
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS )
also do not cause a nonzero exit code.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
does not clean up its lockfile or temporary ZFS snapshots if it is killed.
There may be a problematic glob passed to
.Ar --exclude
and
.Nm
may not handle LXD datasets right.
