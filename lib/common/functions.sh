	# The trap is in the subshell to prevent a subtle race condition. If the subprocess was
	# scheduled by the kernel before the parent process was, all was well because it would be
	# able to open the FIFO. However, if the parent reached EOF, ran the cleanup code in the EXIT
	# trap, and exited before the subprocess was scheduled, then by the time the subprocess
	# opened the FIFO to be file descriptor 0, the FIFO would already have been cleaned up.
	#
	# Thus, we simply run the trap in the subprocess so that cleanup is tied to the logging channel
	# itself, not the parent process. This is (arguably) a more logically consistent place to put
	# this cleanup *and*, as a bonus, it means we do not need to require calling code to register
	# a cleanup function as a part of their EXIT traps.
